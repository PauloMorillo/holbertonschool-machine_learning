# Keras

This directory has the exercises to learn about Keras API to create a model using all that I have seen (layers, optimization, regularization, activation functions, and more)
## Before to code

Topics to learn:

What is Keras?
What is a model?
How to instantiate a model (2 ways)
How to build a layer
How to add regularization to a layer
How to add dropout to a layer
How to add batch normalization
How to compile a model
How to optimize a model
How to fit a model
How to use validation data
How to perform early stopping
How to measure accuracy
How to evaluate a model
How to make a prediction with a model
How to access the weights/outputs of a model
What is HDF5?
How to save and load a model’s weights, a model’s configuration, and the entire model
