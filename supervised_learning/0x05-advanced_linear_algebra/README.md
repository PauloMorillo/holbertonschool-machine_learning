## Before to code

Topics to learn:

What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?
