# Databases

After fetching data via APIs, storing them is also really important for training a Machine Learning model.

Relation databases are mainly used for application, not for source of data for training your ML models, but it can be really useful for the data processing, labeling and injection in another data storage. In this project, you will play with basic SQL commands but also create automation and computing on your data directly in SQL - less load at your application level since the computing power is dispatched to the database.

Not relation databases, known as NoSQL, will give you flexibility on your data: document, versioning, not a fix schema, no validation to improve performance, complex lookup, etc.
